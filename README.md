# SQL-Practice-Problems

A collection of the code created as I work through the book "SQL Practice Problems" by Sylvia Moestl Vasilik.

These problems were worked in MS SQL Server Management Studio. 
I'm omitting the first 10 or so problems because those are just simple single table SELECT statements. 
After that it begins to get a little more interesting with data manipution and JOINs.


All the problems are based on a practice database called Northwind_SPP, which represents a generic sales 
company with tales for Orders, OrderDetails, Products, Categories, Suppliers, Shippers, Employees, Customers,
and CustomerGroupThresholds.
